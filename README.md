## Description
A collection of three simple PHP forms demonstrating form creation, data submission, and display.

♡ The second form collects last name, first name, gender, and course selection, displaying the data similarly.  
♡ The third form collects last name, first name, address, city, and postal code, displaying the information in a table format.  

All forms are styled using Bootstrap.
